File Sender

We are working on a java project (Desktop application) which not only sends Messages but also files occupying upto 2 GB.The sile feature is designed to send files.We're currently working on it and will update it after further testing.
Presently it can just send files, but as soon as we add sile feature, people will be able to send anything from pictures to pdfs to even movies!
